You will write two programs: 

nblearn.py will learn a naive Bayes model from the training data, 
 > python nblearn.py /path/to/text/file /path/to/label/file
The arguments are the two training files; the program will learn a naive Bayes model, and write the model parameters to a file called nbmodel.txt

nbclassify.py will use the model to classify new data.
The classification program will be invoked in the following way:
> python nbclassify.py /path/to/text/file
The argument is the test data file, which has the same format as the training text file. The program will read the parameters of a naive 

Bayes model from the file nbmodel.txt, classify each entry in the test data, and write the results to a text file called nboutput.txt in the same format as the label file from the training data.

•	A text file train-text.txt with a single training instance (hotel review) per line. The first token in each line is a unique 20-character alphanumeric identifier, which is followed by the text of the review.
•	A label file train-labels.txt with labels for the corresponding reviews. Each line consists of three tokens: a unique 20-character alphanumeric identifier corresponding to a review, a label truthful or deceptive, and a label positive or negative.
Each data file contains 1280 lines, corresponding to 1280 reviews.
