This repository contains various assignments performed as a part of a Natural Language Processing course. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of NLP:\n\n1. Implementing a NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier\n2. Performing Part of Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Model\n3. Calculating Bleu Score for Machine Translation as defined by Papineni, Roukos, Ward and Zhu (2002)\n\nFor the BLEU score calculation, you are given a Python program which takes two paths as parameters: the first to a candidate translation (a single file), and the second to the reference translations (either a single file, or a directory if there are multiple reference translations). The program produces an output file named "bleu_out.txt", containing a single floating point number representing the BLEU score of the candidate translation relative to the set of reference translations. You can run the program with the command: \n > python calculatebleu.py /path/to/candidate /path/to/reference\n\nThe German, Greek and Portuguese reference translations are excerpts from the common test set of the EUROPARL corpus; the candidate translations are results from running the corresponding English sentences through Google Translate. The English reference translations are from two different translations of the Passover Hagaddah; the candidate translation was prepared by running the original Hebrew text through Google translate.\n\nDetailed instruction and help can be found at: http://ron.artstein.org/csci544-2017/homework-8.html\n\nThis repository is currently maintained by Go3n.
